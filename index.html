        <h1>The Beagle Dog Information</h1>
        <p>The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much
            larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as
            beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the
            beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural
            imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent
            and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health
            problems.</p>
